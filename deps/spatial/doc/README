Spatial Documentation
=====================

Generating the documentation
----------------------------

From this directory, execute Doxygen:

$ doxygen

Dependancies the documentation
------------------------------

To generate the bare documentation only Doxygen is required. You can download
Doxygen from its official website:

http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html

A recent version of Doxygen is needed since some of the features required in the
configuration will only be available in the latest version of Doxygen. So it is
best you upgrade your Doxygen version if it is a little old.

Note that Doxygen will not be able to generate the output for the formulas all
by itself. You also require the following tools:

     * latex
     * dvips
     * gs

These tools are part of most TeX distributions. On Linux and BSDs it is
generally not an issue to get these, but on Windows you will need pre-packaged
TeX distributions, such as the one from:

     * http://www.miktex.org/
     * http://w32tex.org/

If you do not have these tools, Doxygen will still include the formulas in the
documentation, however they will appear as LaTeX sources.


Writing the documentation
-------------------------

If you are not documenting a source files from the ../src directory, then you
need to add a file to the meta directory. The meta directory contains all the
files that are not directly linked to the sources, such as the tutorial and the
library description.
